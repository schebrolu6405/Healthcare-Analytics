# Healthcare Analytics Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Power BI project files and scripts for a healthcare analytics dashboard designed to enhance decision-making in healthcare settings. The project facilitates the migration of healthcare data from Excel to a SQL database and employs Power BI for in-depth data visualization and analysis.

## Features

- **Data Migration:** Automate the transfer of data from Excel spreadsheets to a SQL database to enhance data consistency and reliability for analytics.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Utilize Power BI to develop an interactive dashboard that displays crucial healthcare metrics such as patient satisfaction and wait times.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Employ DAX formulas within Power BI to compute sophisticated metrics, providing deeper insights into healthcare operations.
- **Demographic Analysis:** Analyze and visualize healthcare metrics by various demographics, including age and race, to support targeted improvements.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft SQL Server:** Manages the backend database for storing and retrieving healthcare data.
- **Microsoft Power BI:** Used for creating interactive and dynamic visualizations of healthcare data.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Utilized for complex calculations within the Power BI environment.
- **Microsoft Excel:** Serves as the initial platform for data storage before migration to SQL.

## Data

The data encompasses details on patient demographics, service utilization, and feedback across multiple healthcare departments, enabling comprehensive service analysis and optimization.

## Visualizations

This dashboard includes a variety of visual elements:
- **Bar and Pie Charts:** For demographic distribution and service utilization.
- **Line Graphs:** To track trends and changes in patient feedback over time.
- **Heat Maps:** Utilized to identify patterns in wait times and service efficiency across departments.
